# PQ-NAS Authentication v5 — Fully Stateless (WIP)

## Goals
- Fully stateless verification on server (no server-side session state required to validate proof)
- Backward compatibility: keep v4 working while v5 is behind feature flag / endpoint versioning
- Explicit security properties documented (replay, expiry, binding, origin/rpId, device binding, etc.)

## Non-goals
- (fill)
